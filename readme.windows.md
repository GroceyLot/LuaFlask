# LuaFlask

***LuaFlask is a fast php-like flask server using lua for scripting on the server.***

To setup, install python3 and pip from the internet. 3.10 minimum.

Then, in cmd run `setup.bat`.

Then, to start the server just run `serve.bat`.

I can't figure out how to make it run in the background just ask chatgpt.
